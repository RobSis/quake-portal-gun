Information for Mappers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You can find all the map sources in   src/maps/
The maps use id_base.wad and portal.wad. Both present in the same directory.



Entities
========
______________________________________
ass_hardlight ? START_OFF PORTAL_PROOF
--------------------------------------
  Creates a invisible wall that can be toggled on and off.

  START_OFF      wall doesn't block until triggered.
  PORTAL_PROOF   when the wall is toggled, you can't shoot portal through it.


NOTE, that it is truly invisible. It's best to combine with particlefield, so
player can see what's blocking him... The same goes for other energy grills.

______________________________
func_particlefield ? USE_COUNT
------------------------------
   Creates a brief particle flash roughly the size of the defining
   brush each time it is triggered.

  USE_COUNT when the activator is a func_counter, the field will only
      activate when count is equal to "cnt".  Same as using a func_oncount
      to trigger.

  "cnt" is the count to activate on when USE_COUNT is set.
  "color" is the color of the particles.  Default is 192 (yellow).
  "count" is the density of the particles.  Default is 2.
  "noise" is the sound to play when triggered.  Do not use a looping sound here.
  "dmg" is the amount of damage to cause when touched.


NOTE about colors. The number of colors is limited. We can use yellow (192)
Use counter to make some neat cycle effects. (see pellet.map for example)


_______________
ass_portalproof
---------------
   Creates the wall, that can't bear portals. Defined by brush.

There is texture for portal-proof walls in portal.wad

_________
ass_grill
---------
   Material Emancipation Grill
     - disintegrates every object but player and his gun. TODO
     - reboots gun (closes portals)


________________
ass_gravitygrill
----------------
    Grill that changes gravity when touched by player.

    "gravity" - what to set the player's gravity to
       - 0 (default) normal gravity
       - 1 no gravity
       - 2 almost no gravity
         ...
       - 101 normal gravity
       - 102 slightly higher gravity
         ...
       - 1000 very high gravity

     the same goes subzero ;)

NOTE: changing gravity wasn't implemented until hipnotic's expansion pack.
So the original dos quake ( v1.06 ) engine doesn't support it...
NOTE: also note, that player can "take" gravity with him...
Anyway, this entity is experimental, don't have to be used at all...


_____________
ass_killgrill
-------------
    Grill that hurts player when touched.

    "dmg" - amount of damage to cause to player.
            default - 100
